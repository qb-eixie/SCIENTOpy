This study aims to emphasize the importance of work-life balance and to examine the relationship between work-life balance and happiness. Focusing on physical activities and workplace health among the various ways for employee health is one way to ensure employee health and productivity. Managing long working hours in personal life increases employee stress. It consists of various fields related to the IT industry, computer, and digital information. IT professionals are the most in-demand members of today's labor market, as the industry's largest companies fight to expand the adoption of digital technologies. Employers are continually striving to ensure that their employees do their jobs in the best possible way without getting tired. Employee Work-Life Balance is measured by the employee's mental and physical investment in the workplace. You are dedicated to your work in terms of time, energy, and level of motivation to work towards achieving organizational success. This paper purposes to measure happiness and employee work-life balance as a measure of physical activity. Smart-PLS 3.2.8 creates a conceptual reflex model using measures of physical activity and happiness and work-life balance as survey components. © 2022 by authors,.","General Motor Fitness; Heath Fitness; Mental Health; Physical Activities; Physical Exercise; Work-Life Balance",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Zheng, C, Molineux, J, Mirshekary, S, Scarparo, S., Developing individual and organisational work-life balance strategies to improve employee health and wellbeing (2015) Empl Relations, 37 (3), pp. 354-379. , https://www.emerald.com/insight/content/doi/10.1108/ER-10-2013-0142/full/html, [Internet].

Psoriasis, uveitis, ulcerative colitis, and inflammatory bowel disease form part of the systemic manifestations. There exists a long delay between the onset of inflammatory back pain and being diagnosed with ankylosing spondylitis. Methodology: We set out to study the clinical profile, diagnosis, and management of patients with spondyloarthritis (SpA) prospectively and follow-up over 2 years period. All patients who had inflammatory back pain and diagnosed to have SpA were included in this prospective study in two different centers of Rheumatology. Clinical characteristics, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)-spine and sacroiliac joints, disease activity using Bath Ankylosing Spondylitis Disease Activity Index (BASDAI), Bath Ankylosing Spondylitis Functional Index (BASFI), and early treatment response were assessed. Other investigations including bloods, X-rays, and screening for biologics were done as and when indicated. We used both synthetic Disease-Modifying AntiRheumatic Drugs (DMARDS) and biosimilars as per the British Society of Rheumatology guidelines and patient choice. Patients were reviewed every 3 months for 1-2 years. The response to treatment was assessed and compared with other studies. Results: Forty-two patients were studied in this 2 years period (15 patients out of 57 lost to follow up). All patients had the diagnosis of ankylosing spondylitis as per Assessment of Spondylo Arthritis international Society (ASAS Score) criteria and MRI evidence of sacroiliitis and 22 patients had peripheral synovitis. HLA-B27 was positive in 11/19 patients. Eleven patients had been on anti-Tumor Necrosis Factor (TNF) drugs and 26 patients were on DMARDs. At the end of 24 weeks, disease activity indices including BASDAI and BASFI were low in remission and statistically significant. At the end of 2 years, most of them were in remission and 81% were continuing to work and maintain productivity. Patients who underwent treatment with biosimilar TNFs showed a significant reduction in disease activity and achieved remission earlier, as evidenced by BASDAI and BASFI scores, compared to others who were on DMARDS and supportive therapy. The usage of DMARDS was more than biosimilar drugs as they are expensive. Conclusion: This study shows the real-world data on the diagnosis and management of patients with ankylosing spondylitis, achieving remission, and maintaining the work-life balance. Early diagnosis with MRI and appropriate intervention with DMARDS are the important factors in this study. © 2022 Wolters Kluwer Medknow Publications.

We conducted an online survey to evaluate the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on domestic responsibilities among Indian physicians to look for gender-based differences by collecting data regarding domestic work and childcare, changes in work patterns, and lack of domestic help during the pandemic and the resultant nationwide lockdown. Through this study, we reported the results of a nationwide survey and showed how gender gaps exist, even within highly qualified professionals such as physicians, and how the COVID-19 pandemic has widened this gap. Our study showed statistically higher contribution by women physicians as compared to men not only in the increased domestic work, but also when it came to childcare and education. More women than men were forced to take additional leave and quit their jobs due to the increased domestic responsibilities.In addition to highlighting the difficulties faced by the physician community as a whole due to nonavailability of domestic help and childcare facilities, this survey demonstrated the intense challenges women physicians face as they try to navigate the work-life balance dilemma by providing care to their families as well as patients. Our study highlighted the need to re-examine the specific challenges faced by women physicians and identify means to support and empower them. © 2022 Indian Society of Medical and Paediatric Oncology.

As the COVID-19 pandemic has relocated all non-essential work to the home setting, it becomes imperative to examine the phenomenon through a gender lens. Accordingly, I conducted a qualitative study using semi-structured interviews with 30 dual-earning married couples in India to study the gendered work-from-home experiences of men and women during the pandemic. The findings suggest that the pandemic has disproportionately increased the burden of unpaid work for women as compared to men. Women are negotiating gendered time–space arrangements within their households with the allocation of limited resources being in favor of men. When this interacts with work, gender inequalities are reinforced both at work and home. Gender roles and unpaid work determine women’s choices regarding when and where to work, boundary management between work and non-work domains, and their experiences of social isolation. Further, gender roles have also affected women’s decisions regarding returning to work post-pandemic, where some women may not be returning to work at all. Finally, the paper identifies how gender intersects with the existing conceptual frameworks of working from home, and makes a strong case for integrating gender considerations in the work-from-home policies. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.","Autonomy; COVID-19; Gender roles; Unpaid work; Work-from-home; Work-life balance",,,,,,"Sylff Association","I thank the Sylff Association for their support through the Ryoichi Sasakawa Young Leaders Fellowship Fund (Sylff) Program ( http://www.sylff.org/ ).

However, the pandemic seems to have had adverse effects on research of women faculty that is likely to impinge on their future prospects of career advancement.

Occupational stress causes a negative impact on both the work and personal life of professionals. Previous studies have established that occupational stress of construction professionals is strongly associated with low productivity, high absenteeism, and poor work performance. However, there is a lack of scientific studies that provide linkages between occupational stressors and the dimensions of work-life balance. The present research aims to study the perceived level of occupational stress and assess its relationship with the dimensions of work-life balance among construction professionals. Within an established theoretical framework, eight hypotheses were formulated to investigate the above relationship. A cross-sectional survey-based approach was adopted to assess the level of occupational stress and work-life balance. The survey was administered among construction project managers, project engineers, and site engineers in the Indian context. With 285 valid responses, relative importance index and multiple regression analysis methods were utilised to analyse the collected data. The findings revealed major stressors that contribute to high levels of occupational stress under work-related and organisation-related stressor categories. The top five identified stressors included job nature demands coordination with multiple stakeholders, tight time frame for work, unstable working hours, bureaucracy, and quantitative work overload. With regards to the relationship between the categories of occupational stress and work-life balance, the results indicate that work-related stressors are significantly and positively related to work interference to personal life (WIPL) and personal life interference to work (PLIW) and negatively relate to work enhancement of personal life (WEPL) and personal life enhancement of work (PLEW). In the case of organisation-related stressors, both organisation policy and organisation position-related stressors significantly and positively influence WIPL however, no significant relationship was noticed with PLIW, WEPL, and PLEW. While the existing studies have provided evidence that work-life imbalance causes occupational stress, one of the major contributions of the present study is that it provides valid scientific evidence that occupational stress significantly influences work-life life balance negatively. The study’s findings with regards to unveiling the relationship between the categories of occupational stressors and dimensions of work-life balance would help organisations derive relevant policies for creating a supportive work environment. To this end, the paper advances our collective understanding of occupational stress and work-life balance with multiple dimensions and perspectives. © 2022 by the author(s).","Construction Professionals; Indian Construction Industry; Occupational Stress; Stressors; Work-Life Balance",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Anandh, K.S., Gunasekaran, K., An investigation on stress among the professionals in the Indian construction industry (2018) Construction Research Congress 2018, pp. 1-7. , https://doi.org/10.1061/9780784481288.001, New Orleans, Louisiana, April 2-4, 2018; Anandh, K.S., Gunasekaran, K., Mannan, M.A., Investigation on the factors affecting lifestyle of professionals in the construction industries (Kerala and Tamil Nadu) (2020) International Journal of Integrated Engineering, 12 (9), pp. 246-252. , https://doi.org/10.30880/ijie.2020.12.09.029; An, N., Qiang, M., Wen, Q., Jiang, H., Xia, B., Contribution of project managers’ capability to project ending performance under stressful conditions (2018) European Management Journal, 30, p. 1e12; Apraku, K., Bondinuba, F.K., Eyiah, A.K., Sadique, A.M., Construction workers work-life balance: A tool for improving productivity in the construction industry (2020) Social Work and Social Welfare, 2 (1), pp. 45-52. , https://doi.org/10.25082/SWSW.2020.01.001; Ball, M., (2014) Rebuilding construction: Economic change in the British construction industry, , London: Routledge; Beauregard, T.A., Henry, L.C., Making the link between work-life balance practices and organisational performance (2009) Human resource management review, 19 (1), pp. 9-22. , https://doi.org/10.1016/j.hrmr.2008.09.001; Berglund, E., Anderzén, I., Andersén, Å., Lindberg, P., Work-life balance predicted work ability two years later: a cohort study of employees in the Swedish energy and water sector (2021) BMC Public Health, 21 (1), pp. 1-12. , https://doi.org/10.1186/s12889-021-11235-4; Bowen, P., Govender, R., Edwards, P., Structural equation modeling of occupational stress in the construction industry (2014) Journal of Construction Engineering and Management, 140 (9), p. 04014042. , https://doi.org/10.1061/(ASCE)CO.1943-7862.0000877; Bryce, T., Far, H., Gardner, A., Barriers to career advancement for female engineers in Australia’s civil construction industry and recommended solutions (2019) Australian Journal of Civil Engineering, 17 (1), pp. 1-10. , https://doi.org/10.1080/14488353.2019.1578055; Bryson, K., Duncan, A., (2018) BRANZ Study Report: Mental health in the construction industry scoping study, , https://d39d3mj7qio96p.cloudfront.net/media/documents/SR411_Mental_health_in_the_construction_industry.pdf, [online]; Campbell, F., (2006) Occupational stress in the construction industry, , Berkshire, UK: Chartered Institute of Building; Cattell, K., Bowen, P., Edwards, P., Stress among South African construction professionals: a job demand-control-support survey (2016) Construction Management and Economics, 34 (10), pp. 700-723. , https://doi.org/10.1080/01446193.2016.1203967; Chimote, N.K., Srivastava, V.N., Work-life balance benefits: From the perspective of organisations anemployees (2013) IUP Journal of Management Research, 12 (1), p. 62; Cochran, W.G., (2007) Sampling techniques, , 3rd ed.

Work-life balance has emerged as a critical area of human resource management, attracting the attention of government, researchers, and professionals in search of innovative ways to boost employee morale, retain employees, and provide employers with tools to help them achieve a better work-life balance. Employees’ emotional and physical health’s are both affected by an unhealthy work environment. Stress was viewed as a sign of weakness in many businesses. Research purpose: This study investigates the mediating effect of occupational stress on the relationship between work-life balance (WLB) and organisational work environment among academics, as well as the moderating effect of demographic variables such as gender, job levels, and marital status of this relationship. Research approach/design and method: Using a survey method, primary data was collected from academics working in India. A structured questionnaire was drafted and introduced as a method for data collection. Respondents were chosen using a judgemental sampling method. To test the hypothesis, the mediating effect and moderating effect were used, and the statistical regression analysis was done with the help of Professor Andrew’s process macro and partial least squares smart (PLS). Main findings: The organisational work environment had a significant impact on the WLB of academics employed at higher education institutes in India. When comparing male and female academics, the effect of the organisational work environment on occupational stress was found to be higher for female academics. For academics at various job levels, the impact of the organisational work environment on occupational stress was found to be significant. Marital status had no significant moderating association effect on academics between WLB, occupational stress, and organisational work environment. Implications: Institutions are encouraged to provide family-friendly policies and create a good work environment for academics that helps decrease the stress level, improve the WLB and increase the efficiency and effectiveness of academics. Contribution: An investigation into relationships between work-life balance, occupational stress and working environment holds a number of implications in the management of educational set-up. This research might be very useful to school administrators in terms of improving work-life balance and reducing occupational stress among academics, in order to create a work environment that everyone is glad to be a part of. As a result, academic institutions’ organisational efficiency and effectiveness will improve. © 2022.

Through a basic exploratory qualitative study, we examined the challenges faced by leaders in both countries and how they evolved their leadership behaviours to meet employee needs and maintain business continuity. Even though situations resulting from the national lockdown and remote work varied across the two countries, leaders faced similar challenges with employee productivity, increased isolation, teamwork, client interactions, and employee’s work life balance. Our findings confirm that leaders from heterogeneous countries exhibit homogeneous behaviours. Leaders invested in increasing their virtual presence, demonstrates exemplary behaviour, and practiced distributed leadership to enable seamless communication among team members. © 2022 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","business continuity; COVID-19; Information technology; leadership behaviours; leadership challenges",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Akdere, M., Hickman, L., Kirchner, M., Developing Leadership Competencies for STEM Fields: The Case of Purdue Polytechnic Leadership Academy (2019) Advances in Developing Human Resources, 21 (1), pp. 49-71; Altman, D., Understanding the US Failure on Coronavirus–an Essay by Drew Altman (2020) Bmj, 370, p. m3417; Alvesson, M., Sveningsson, S., Managers Doing Leadership: The Extra-Ordinarization of the Mundane (2003) Human Relations, 56 (12), pp. 1435-1459; Alzoubi, R.H.M., Jaffar, A.M., Leadership Styles, Crisis Management, and Hotel Performance: A Conceptual Perspective of the Jordanian Hotel Industry (2020) Journal of Critical Reviews, 7 (10), pp. 556-562; (2007) How to Build a High-Performance Organization: A Global Study of Current Trends and Future Possibilities 2007-2017, , http://www.gsu.edu/images/HR/HRI-high-performance07, New York: AMA; (2020) COVID-19 & the Technology Sector, , https://www.aon.com/unitedkingdom/insights/covid-19-and-the-technology-sector.jsp; Avolio, B., (2010) Full Range Leadership Development, , California: Sage; Azizah, S., Nurhayati, S., Anggraeni, A., Helmy, I., (2021) The Impact of Transformational Leadership on Innovative Capability: Mediating Role of Employee Optimism.Management Science Letters, 11 (2), pp. 435-440; Bandura, A., Self-Efficacy: Toward a Unifying Theory of Behavioral Change (1977) Psychological Review, 84 (2), pp. 191-215; Barhate, B., Hirudayaraj, M., Perceptions of Software Employees Towards HRD Roles and Functions (2018) Helix: The Scientific Journal, 8 (6), pp. 4184-4189; Barhate, B., Hirudayaraj, M., Emerging Career Realities During the Pandemic: What Does It Mean for Women’s Career Development?

We test these ideas in two experiments. In study 1, using carefully constructed vignettes to manipulate work–life balance (WLB) benefits, employee recommendation, and job attributes in a 2 × 2 × 2 between-subjects design and with data gathered from 320 Indian MBA students, we found support for the direct and interactive effects of these variables on employer attractiveness. In study 2, using a 3 × 2 × 2 between-subjects design and data from 360 Indian MBA students, we examined the influence of three different alternative work arrangements, a form of WLB benefit, and how such benefits interact with employee recommendations and job attributes to influence job pursuit intentions.

In the context of the extant research, the focus is on the health care workers, who are the front-line warriors during the Covid-19 pandemic. They include amongst others doctors, nurses and health care administrators. The contributions of these front-line workers during this pandemic are invaluable. However, they have to face the brunt of the pandemic which affected work life balance enormously. In this background, the present paper is an initiative to understand the various dynamics related to the work life balance of health care workers, particularly during the pandemic, and for this purpose four leading hospitals in the study area were selected for collection of data. The entire data were analyzed under four parameters, work pressure related issues, infrastructure and family issues, organizational policy, and work related cash and non-cash benefits. Overall, twenty two hypotheses were developed and out of these seven null hypotheses and fifteen alternative hypotheses were accepted. As regards to the work pressure related issues three null and three alternative hypotheses were developed, whereas basing on infrastructure and family issues one null and three alternate hypotheses were accepted. On the basis of organization policies, seven hypotheses were developed and all of them were accepted as all alternative hypotheses and similarly, out of five hypotheses related to cash and non-cash benefits, three null and two alternative hypotheses were accepted. Concerns and difficulties in the workplace and personal problems in life affect each other. The equilibrium of work-life is conceived as a dual system that gives fair weightage to the demands of both the employees and employers. There cannot be an equal balance between work and life, rather, it is a matter of prioritizing and managing the burden of each field in order to align time, energy, and resources so that work and life are satisfied. The present paper is an endeavor to decode the various issues related to work life balance of health care workers in the new normal. The paper is hoped to be an additional contribution to the existing literature. © 2022 Sami Publishing Company.

The analysis of women's experiences revealed the enablers and deterrents faced by these women in their leadership trajectories. These factors are categorized as an individual: family background and childhood experiences, self-aspiration and leadership development and work-life balance and familial support or organizational viz. workplace and sociocultural challenges and success mantras. A combination of them has influenced the progression of these women. The results present the need for a massive social change initiated by human service organizations to shift the so-called patriarchal social system. The paper has identified various dimensions like prioritizing promoting diversity, mentoring, and redesign of human resource policies which need to be focused. Also, the organizations and government can use these findings to design development programs for realistically promoting more women to higher positions. © 2022 Universiti Putra Malaysia.

A structured questionnaire was adopted comprising of 19 questions with six questions pertaining to work related infrastructure at home. Data was collected from 138 full time employees working from home which revealed the influence of work dependence, work environment and work life balance which were hypothesized to be directly related to the willingness to work from home in future if given an opportunity. Qualitative analysis revealed that job performance, social interaction and supervisor’s role related hypothesis are refuted. The study tries to bridge the gap between the existing research done in past during normal course of time and current pandemic. The current research of WFH during the Covid 19 in employees working from home in India is an attempt to assess the antecedents in current situation. These results have important theoretical and practical implications. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.","Cataclysm; COVID 19; Lockdown; Virtual workspace; Work from home",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Allen, T.D., Golden, T.D., Shockley, K.M., How effective is telecommuting?

This is distinct not from the perspective of an overwhelming level of personal and professional accomplishment, but from the huge amount of psychological stress and anxiety involved in it. Earlier studies show that health workers, particularly medical practitioners, are vulnerable to mental health developments. Furthermore, workplace stress has been related to emotional exhaustion, which can result in a lack of enthusiasm for work, feelings of powerlessness, depression, and defeat. Emotional factors inherent to the job, responsibilities related to patient needs, feeling of being overburdened, organizational responsibilities, and issues related to working relationships and career growth are commonly identified as occupational stressors among medical professionals. Emotional fatigue is commonly referred to as burnout among professionals. The present paper is an initiative to understand the various dynamics of work life balance during pandemic and to undertake the empirical study on the topic. In this regard, the authors undertook the secondary sources for preparing the paper. The present initiative will be a value addition to the existing literature. © 2022 by SPC (Sami Publishing Company).","COVID-19; Life (QWL); New normal and quality of work; Work life balance",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Wu, Y., Wang, J., Luo, C., Hu, S., Lin, X., Anderson, A.E., Qian, Y., (2020) J.

This can be attributed to the prevailing eating habits as well as unhealthy work-life balance and lifestyle. There have been many instances where scientists, researchers, and innovators working in the domains of engineering, biotechnology, and healthcare have proposed novel ways to monitor the cardiac activity of a diseased person. Such monitoring systems started with the advent of electrocardiography followed by other methods, such as echocardiography, phonocardiography, and photoplethysmography, which led to better patient care. Recently, there has been growing interest to monitor the cardiac activity by mechanical movements of the body parts/surfaces, which has led to the beginning of new fields, such as gyrocardiography, ballistocardiography, seismocardiography, and forcecardiography. All these mechanical sensors have very sophisticated components attached to them, thus making them relatively less available in low-cost settings. In this work, we propose a proof-of-concept to optically measure the seismic thumps due to the heartbeats by keeping a reflecting surface over the epigastric region of the abdominopelvic cavity. Due to these thumps, the reflecting surface moved vertically and the position of the image of an otherwise stationary object in the reflecting surface was monitored using a camera. This mechanism is an inexpensive alternative to replace the costly MEMS components that constitute mechanical cardiograms and would reduce the cost of measurements substantially. It would be of great interest to scientists and healthcare researchers to explore the viable alternatives to low-cost settings. © 2022 Author(s).",,"Cardiology; Costs; Developing countries; Health care; Heart; Phonocardiography; Cardiac activity; Cardiac disease; Cardiac rhythms; Causes of death; Eating habits; Leadless; Low-costs; Measurements of; Optical reflection; Reflecting surface; Echocardiography",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Cardiovascular Diseases, , https://www.who.int/health-topics/cardiovascular-diseases, accessed on 08 October 2021; Stewart, J., Manmathan, G., Wilkinson, P., Primary prevention of cardiovascular disease: A review of contemporary guidance and literature (2017) JRSM Cardiovasc.

This paper draws attention to the triple burden on the women during this time when certain roles are supposed to be performed by the women regardless she is employed or homemaker. The paper highlights the challenges faced by women educationists in making themselves comfortable with the work-life balance with emerging challenges such as new technology-based innovative teaching methods and various learning software’s, apps, platforms, etc. The paper employs in-depth interviews of teachers belonging to three categories i.e. primary, secondary, and higher education. The findings reported that female teachers agreed that pandemic had affected their daily life schedule. This leaves a deep effect on their mental and psychological health due to multiple attentions they pay towards home management, child & elders extra care, challenges due to work from home pattern of organizations, increased attention to students due to online teaching, etc. The paper presents the implications for the society and government to understand the women’s pressure so that a happy and satisfied life is there for all with no gender discrimination. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.","COVID-19; Education; Gender biasness; Pandemic; Teachers; Virtual platform",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Alves, R., Lopes, T., Precioso, J., Teachers' well-being in times of Covid-19 pandemic: Factors that explain professional well-being (2021) IJERI: International Journal of Educational Research and Innovation, 15, pp. 203-217; Aryee, S., Srinivas, E.S., Tan, H.H., Rhythms of life: Antecedents and outcomes of work-family balance in employed parents (2005) Journal of Applied Psychology, 90 (1), pp. 132-146; Aycan, Z., Key success factors for women in management in Turkey (2004) Applied Psychology: An International Review., 53 (3), pp. 453-477; Bahn, K., Cohen, J., van der Meulen Rodgers, Y., A feminist perspective on COVID-19 and the value of care work globally (2020) Gender, Work and Organization, 27 (5), pp. 695-699; Bao, W., COVID -19 and online teaching in higher education: A case study of Peking University (2020) Human Behavior and Emerging Technologies, 2 (2), pp. 113-115; Beland, L.-P., Brodeur, J., Haddadmikola, D., Covid-19, family stress and domestic violence: Remote work, isolation and bargaining power.

However, they can only provide quality services if their work environment provides adequate conditions to support them. Today the employment and working conditions of many nurses worldwide are precarious, and the current pandemic has prompted more visibility to the vulnerability to health-damaging factors of nurses’ globally. This desk review explores how employment relations, and employment and working conditions may be negatively affecting the health of nurses in countries such as Brazil, Croatia, India, Ireland, Italy, México, Nepal, Spain, and the United Kingdom. Main body: Nurses’ health is influenced by the broader social, economic, and political system and the redistribution of power relations that creates new policies regarding the labour market and the welfare state. The vulnerability faced by nurses is heightened by gender inequalities, in addition to social class, ethnicity/race (and caste), age and migrant status, that are inequality axes that explain why nurses’ workers, and often their families, are exposed to multiple risks and/or poorer health. Before the COVID-19 pandemic, informalization of nurses’ employment and working conditions were unfair and harmed their health. During COVID-19 pandemic, there is evidence that the employment and working conditions of nurses are associated to poor physical and mental health. Conclusion: The protection of nurses’ health is paramount. International and national enforceable standards are needed, along with economic and health policies designed to substantially improve employment and working conditions for nurses and work–life balance.

Nonetheless, women fall far behind their male counterparts when it comes to leadership roles as indicated by recent research data. Materials and Methods: This was a cross-sectional study amongst 180 dermatologists. Anonymous surveys were sent to 300 dermatologists across India, in March 2021, consisting of 14 questions, discussed and made by the two authors, the senior author having held leadership positions in dermatology. Results: Amongst the 180 respondents, 79% were female, and 21% were male. Significant attrition of women dermatologists in academic institutions, with increasing experience in the field was observed. A higher percentage of men had been in a leadership position as compared to women. (P > .05). The majority of the female respondents agreed that women had to struggle more than men to be accepted as leaders. (P < 0.05) Most women reduced their working hours to cater to household responsibilities, and almost 70% of the women agreed to having experienced burnout as a result of low job satisfaction or an absence of work-life balance (P < 0.05). More women agreed to having faced discrimination at the workplace (P < 0.05). Conclusion: Gender-based gaps in dermatology leadership still exist with regard to the number of women occupying higher academic ranks. Possible solutions include gender sensitization, creating a room for equivalent leadership opportunities, mentorship and family support, which may help tip the balance in favor of gender parity in dermatology. © 2021 Indian Dermatology Online Journal.","Academics; Dermatology; Gender; Leadership; Women",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Pincus, S., Women in academic dermatology.

Due to the unprecedentedness of the situation, academicians and practitioners have limited knowledge of the effect permanently working from home during this crisis can have on employees. Developing the role and work–life balance theories and using the job demands and resources model, the authors study the role of availability of job autonomy and family supportive supervisory behaviors (FSSBs) directly on work–life balance and indirectly on job satisfaction through work–life balance for Industry 4.0 based employees. Using work-to-family positive spillover (WFPS) as a first-level moderator and prior telecommuting experience (PTE) as a second-level moderator, the authors also check for the moderating effect on work–life balance and job satisfaction, respectively. The data were analyzed using CFA and SEM in AMOS v21.0 and model 21 in PROCESS Macro for SPSS. The study found that job autonomy and FSSBs have significant positive direct and indirect effects on work–life balance and job satisfaction, respectively, and these relationships are positively moderated by WFPS and PTE, respectively. The study focuses on the human factor of Industry 4.0, adds empirical insights to the work–family interface literature, and has implications that will help both employees and organizations during such critical times. © 2021 by the authors.

The study further investigates person‐job fit as an underlying mechanism of the association between WLB practices and turnover intention. The study’s data were collected through a self-administered questionnaire garnered from 550 full‐time academics working in higher educational institutions in South India (Andhra Pradesh, Karnataka, Kerala, Tamil Nadu, and Telangana, as well as the union territories of Lakshadweep and Puducherry). Partial least squares structural equation modelling (PLS‐SEM) was employed for the statistical analysis of the data, using Smart PLS 3.2.8 software. The study ascertained that WLB practices have a negative impact on academics’ turnover intention. Additionally, the study discovered that WLB practices have a positive impact on PJF. Similarly, PJF seems to have a significant negative influence on turnover intention. Moreover, PJF partially and negatively mediates the influence of WLB practices on turnover intention. Conse-quently, this study suggests implementing several WLB practices (e.g., telecommuting, job sharing, flexitime, paid parental leave, etc.) into higher educational institutions, since it may not only improve academics’ perception of their person‐job fit but it may also reduce their turnover intention. © 2021 by the authors.

This unprecedented time and global health crisis pushed everyone indoors and compelled all employees to work from home (WFH). This study is an attempt to explore the challenges and possibilities of the WFH scenario in the context of working women in India. Around 203 women professionals participated through Google form questionnaire from May–June 2020 to fathom the impact of lockdown while working in the WFH format. This study employs the ‘the Standpoint theory’ and the theory of ‘Performative action’ by Judith Butler to grasp the work-life balance and gender roles in family spaces. The results of the study have shown that although the spouses of these women are sharing some responsibilities of household and children, but still the main onus rests on women's shoulders. The identities attached with their working and non-working status have been fused with the arrival of paid work at home. The majority of the respondents reported that they have to give a big share of their time to household activities by compromising their work efficacy on the job. © 2021 John Wiley & Sons Australia, Ltd","COVID-19; India; pandemic; work from home; working women",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Andrew, A., Cattan, S., Costa Dias, M., Farquharson, C., Kraftman, L., Krutikova, S., (2020) How are mothers and fathers balancing work and family under lockdown?

Our proposed study was designed to research whether COVID-19 is a driver of digital transformation and to look at the three most positive and negative DT disruptors. Our study suggests that COVID-19 is a driver of digital transformation, since 94 percent of respondents agreed that COVID-19 is a driver of DT. The second phase of our study shows that technology, automation, and collaboration (TAC) is the most positive significant factor which enables work from anywhere (WFA) (or work from home) arrangements and also leads to the third positive factor of a work-life balance (WLB). The top three negative factors are no work-life balance (NWL), social employment issues (SEI), and data security and technology issues (DST). The negative factors show a contradictory result since NWL is the most negative factor, even though WLB is the third most positive factor. While the pandemic situation is leading to a positive situation for economies and organizations at a micro level, the negative impacts, which will affect overall economic growth as well as social, health, and wealth wellbeing, need to be kept in mind. The motivation of this study was to research positive and negative effects of COVID-19 on DT, since COVID-19 is impacting everyone and everyday life, including businesses. Our study developed a unique framework to address both positive and negative adoption.

The European Society for Medical Oncology (ESMO) Resilience Task Force collaboration aimed to provide contemporaneous reports on the impact of COVID-19 on the lived experiences and well-being in oncology. Methods: This online anonymous survey (July-August 2020) is the second of a series of global surveys launched during the course of the pandemic. Longitudinal key outcome measures including well-being/distress (expanded Well-being Index—9 items), burnout (1 item from expanded Well-being Index), and job performance since COVID-19 were tracked. Results: A total of 942 participants from 99 countries were included for final analysis: 58% (n = 544) from Europe, 52% (n = 485) female, 43% (n = 409) ≤40 years old, and 36% (n = 343) of non-white ethnicity. In July/August 2020, 60% (n = 525) continued to report a change in professional duties compared with the pre-COVID-19 era. The proportion of participants at risk of poor well-being (33%, n = 310) and who reported feeling burnout (49%, n = 460) had increased significantly compared with April/May 2020 (25% and 38%, respectively; P < 0.001), despite improved job performance since COVID-19 (34% versus 51%; P < 0.001). Of those who had been tested for COVID-19, 8% (n = 39/484) tested positive; 18% (n = 7/39) felt they had not been given adequate time to recover before return to work. Since the pandemic, 39% (n = 353/908) had expressed concerns that COVID-19 would have a negative impact on their career development or training and 40% (n = 366/917) felt that their job security had been compromised. More than two-thirds (n = 608/879) revealed that COVID-19 has changed their outlook on their work-personal life balance. Conclusion: The COVID-19 pandemic continues to impact the well-being of oncology professionals globally, with significantly more in distress and feeling burnout compared with the first wave. Collective efforts from both national and international communities addressing support and coping strategies will be crucial as we recover from the COVID-19 crisis. In particular, an action plan should also be devised to tackle concerns raised regarding the negative impact of COVID-19 on career development, training, and job security. © 2021 The Authors","burnout; COVID-19; job performance; oncology professionals; resilience; well-being","adult; Africa; Article; Asia; cancer center; comorbidity; coping behavior; coronavirus disease 2019; distress syndrome; drug industry; Europe; female; general hospital; health care organization; helplessness; human; job change; job performance; job security; male; medical society; multidisciplinary team; North America; oncologist; oncology; outcome assessment; outpatient department; Pacific islands; pandemic; personal experience; professional burnout; psychological resilience; South America; wellbeing; work environment; work-life balance; burnout; epidemiology; oncology; pandemic; Adult; Burnout, Professional; COVID-19; Female; Humans; Medical Oncology; Pandemics; SARS-CoV-2",,,,,"Amgen; Bristol-Myers Squibb, BMS; Eli Lilly and Company; Pfizer; AstraZeneca; Bayer; GlaxoSmithKline, GSK; Novartis; Roche; Sanofi; Gilead Sciences; Teva Pharmaceutical Industries; Celgene; Merck Sharp and Dohme, MSD; Les Laboratories Pierre Fabre; Gilead UK and Ireland Corporate Contributions; Vifor Pharma; European Society for Medical Oncology, ESMO; Servier; PharmaMar; Ipsen","We thank all participants for taking part, and national societies and organizations who helped distribute the survey.

As an effort to control the disease spread, the Indian government declared a nationwide lockdown on March 25th, 2020. As dental treatment was considered high risk in the spread of COVID-19, dentistry became one of the most vulnerable professions during this time. Dental professionals had to face job layoffs, salary cuts in professional colleges, closure of private clinics resulting in huge psychological, moral, and financial crises. Studies during the previous and present pandemics have shown mental issues among health care workers necessitating institutional reforms, along with early care and support. A balance in the work-life amongst professionals is the key to better efficiency and, was majorly affected during the COVID-19 pandemic lockdown due to sudden unexpected changes. Hence this study was conducted to understand the changes they underwent both at home and professional front with a hypothesis that physical and mental health, activities, relationship status, and workplace influence the work-life balance. Methods A pre-validated questionnaire survey was done on dentists across India. Structural Equation Modelling and path analysis were applied to the data collected. Results The results of the study supported the hypothesis that factors like physical and mental health, activities, relationship status, and workplace influenced the work-life balance directly. A significant imbalance was seen amongst the female dentists. Conclusion The present study proved the unpreparedness among dental professionals. Hence an evolutionary phase in every field with better working protocols, robust mental health support, and a focus on strategies to face future such emergencies is required. © 2021 Pai et al.

Using panel data and employing fixed effects to control for unobserved individual heterogeneity, we find that these policies have had some success in increasing married women's share of time spent in paid employment. However, the increase in the share of time spent in paid employment is not largely compensated by cutting down the share of time spent in home production. This necessitates the need to cut down the share of time spent for leisure, implying a “double burden” of work for women. Further, work-life balance policies in married men's firms do not appear to significantly influence their time allocation between various activities on a typical working day. We find that although work-life balance policies do not appear to influence the desirability of having a child for all women, they help women with children younger than six years raise the share of time spent in paid employment by largely cutting down their time allocation to home production. © 2021","Home production; Japan; Labour market policies; Paid employment; Panel data; Women",,,,,,"Japan Society for the Promotion of Science, KAKEN: JP18K016490","We are grateful to the participants of the 31st Annual Conference of the European Society for Population Economics, the 1st annual meeting of the Society of Economics of the Household, the 2017 Tokyo Labour Economics Workshop, the 28th International Association for Feminist Economics (IAFFE) Annual Conference, two anonymous referees and the editor for many helpful comments and suggestions.

Methods: An anonymous online survey was proposed to all French dermatologists and dermatology residents to assess the impact of COVID-19 lockdown on their professional activity, their level of stress and their psychological state, as well as their coping strategies. Results: Exactly 800 dermatologists completed the survey. The respondents noted changes in behaviour in their professional and personal environment. The number of cancelled or rescheduled appointments was very high, with a huge financial impact for private practitioners. Stigmatisation was also reported. Anxiety and a feeling of increased stress were very frequent. Increased substance use was also reported. Conclusion: The impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and lockdown was significant for French dermatologists, with risks to their own health, profound changes in their practice, and financial and psychological impact, but also the development of new consultation and evaluation strategies to improve their work–life balance. © 2021","COVID-19; Dermatologist; Lockdown; Psychological impact","alcohol; psychotropic agent; soap; anger; anxiety; Article; cooking; coping behavior; coronavirus disease 2019; data analysis software; depression; dermatologist; e-mail; female; financial management; human; Internet; lockdown; loneliness; male; meditation; mental stress; music; nasopharyngeal swab; online monitoring; pandemic; personal experience; physical abuse; physiological stress; polymerase chain reaction; private practice; professional well-being; psychological aspect; questionnaire; recreational drug use; Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2; social distancing; socioeconomics; sport; suicidal ideation; videoconferencing; walking; work-life balance; yoga; communicable disease control; dermatologist; drug dependence; economics; France; hospital management; management; pandemic; psychology; social stigma; Anxiety; Appointments and Schedules; Communicable Disease Control; COVID-19; Dermatologists; Female; France; Humans; Male; Pandemics; Practice Management; Social Stigma; Stress, Psychological; Substance-Related Disorders; Surveys and Questionnaires; Work-Life Balance",,"alcohol, 64-17-5",,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Zhang, H., Tang, K., Fang, R., Sun, Q., What dermatologists could do to cope with the novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2): a dermatologist's perspective from China (2020) J Eur Acad Dermatol Venereol, 34, pp. e211-e212; Fahmy, D.H., El-Amawy, H.S., El-Samongy, M.A., Fouda, A.A., Soliman, S.H., El-Kady, A., COVID-19 and dermatology: a comprehensive guide for dermatologists (2020) J Eur Acad Dermatol Venereol, 34, pp. 1388-1394; Kwatra, S.J., Sweren, R.J., Grossberg, A.L., Dermatology practices as vectors for COVID-19 transmission: a call for immediate cessation of non-emergent dermatology visits (2020) J Am Acad Dermatol, 82, pp. e179-e180; Gisondi, P., Piaserico, S., Conti, A., Naldi, L., Dermatologists and SARS-CoV-2: the impact of pandemic on daily practice (2020) J Eur Acad Dermatol Venereol, 34, pp. 1196-1201; Bhat, Y.J., Aslam, A., Hassan, I., Dogra, S., Impact of COVID-19 pandemic on dermatologists and dermatology practice (2020) Indian Dermatol Online J, 11, pp. 328-332; Ng, J.N., Cembrano, K.A.G., Wanitphakdeedecha, R., Manuskiatti, W., The aftermath of COVID-19 in dermatology practice: what's next?

All non-essential industries and services have taken a back seat including aesthetic medicine. Over the last decade, India has witnessed a steady growth in medical tourism owing to global standards of care and services at a relatively modest cost. The following study was conducted to ascertain the sea change that this pandemic has brought into aesthetic surgeons’ practice, patient management, planning and consultation. This paper throws light on the journey of Indian aesthetic surgery from its infancy to its current presence in the global market as a context of the study. We have also discussed the impact of social media on aesthetic surgeons’ practice, lifestyle and its role as an emerging new method of medical education. Methods: A questionnaire consisting of 62 questions divided in 3 sections was rolled out to 150 Indian aesthetic surgeons who have been practising either independently in their clinics or are associated with hospitals. A: Pre-COVID practice management and lifestyle; B: life during the lockdown; C: anticipated changes in post-COVID era. Results: In the pre-COVID era, an average aesthetic surgeon was finely balancing his profession, personal lifestyle, learning, and recreation. The lockdown clamped their practices which lead into a financial drought; despite which, they were able to maintain their productivity by engaging in webinars, reading, and research. The post-COVID times demand an implementation of safety protocols along with changes in set-up, regulating patient traffic, engaging in distant learning through virtual conferences, and maintaining a healthy lifestyle acquired during the lockdown. Conclusions: India was rightly witnessing a surge in popularity of aesthetic surgery and medical tourism over the last decade. The corona pandemic has definitely hit this escalating growth curve hard, and it will take some time for the demand to recover. Our study revealed the following conclusions: The effect of COVID 19 demands a major change in aesthetic surgeons’ professional practice like limiting consultations, changing hospital floor plan, following COVID testing, and having new safety protocols. Social media is rightly poised to be a major tool for education and marketing as also for recreation and leisure. The role of teleconsultation needs to be reprised and legalised. Webinars and virtual conferences will find more takers in future. Level of evidence: not ratable. © 2020, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.","COVID; Evolution of aesthetic surgery; India; Pandemic","adult; Article; clinical practice; cohort analysis; coronavirus disease 2019; esthetic surgery; female; financial deficit; health care survey; healthy lifestyle; human; infection control; lifestyle; lockdown; male; medical education; pandemic; plastic surgeon; priority journal; productivity; questionnaire; recreation; social media; teleconference; teleconsultation; work-life balance",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Wang, C., Horby, P.W., Hayden, F.G., Gao, G.F., A novel coronavirus outbreak of global health concern (2020) Lancet, 395, pp. 470-473. , COI: 1:CAS:528:DC%2BB3cXnsVaisLg%3D; Lu, R., Zhao, X., Li, J., Niu, P., Yang, B., Wu, H., Wang, W., Tan, W., Genomic characterisation and epidemiology of 2019 novel coronavirus: implications for virus origins and receptor binding (2020) Lancet, 395, pp. 565-574. , COI: 1:CAS:528:DC%2BB3cXhvFOmsLY%3D; (2020), https://www.who.int/dg/speeches/detail/who-directorgeneral-s-opening-remarks-at-the-media-briefing-on-COVID-19%2D%2D-11-march-2020, March, Accessed March 22, 2020; Davis, L., Surg Gynecol Obstet, 79 (3), p. 329. , September, I94; Esser, J.F.S., Plastic surgery of the face (1917) Ann Surg, 65, p. 297. , COI: 1:STN:280:DC%2BD2srkvVOhsw%3D%3D; Filatov VP PlastieaTigeRonde.

Being in its nascent stage, this phenomenon is little understood. The aim of this article was to study the research gap in the scarce current mompreneurship literature available especially in regards to antecedents and the challenges peculiar to mompreneurs. This gap was studied by reviewing the emerging literature to understand the conceptual definition of mompreneurs and the prominent antecedents and challenges peculiar to mompreneurs. The identified themes were then validated by undertaking the qualitative analysis of the case studies and the narratives of 10 prominent mompreneurs using the “verstehen” technique. The qualitative approach provided the intimate knowledge of the journey, experiences, and the challenges of the leading successful mompreneurs based on which immensely practical recommendations have been offered for the budding mompreneurs which make this study very useful for the audience. © 2022 Georg Thieme Verlag.

It identifies and explains an intriguing post-digitalisation paradox of reported increased job satisfaction and tighter technological control diminishing branch managers' work-life balance. The paradox draws attention to the significance of context in workers' experiences of mobile digital technologies (MDTs) and contradicts previous studies on workers' positive experiences of adopting MDTs: the workers in this study did not experience greater autonomy or flexibility but reported enhanced employment security and status. The paper also adds to literature on employment relations following work digitalisation by revealing powerful enforcement of technological control, with ‘WhatsApp’ identified as a key managerial tool used for surveillance and discipline, and worker resistance at the margins. © 2021 The Authors.

Apart from the focus on the quality of teaching-learning activities, teachers of today are evaluated for their active involvement in professional and societal growth. Women in academia shoulder equal responsibilities as of men, but in India, women play multiple roles in the non-work setting unlike men. The primary objective of this cross-sectional study was to find out the gender difference in Work-Life Balance (WLB) among teachers of higher education. Institutional Ethical Committee’s approval was obtained. Data was collected using the WLB questionnaire, from 127 male and 136 female faculties employed on a tenure basis in the Public Universities in Karnataka. The multiple regression analysis indicated an association of better WLB with the upper age group, male gender, and faculties of science discipline. Strategies at the organizational level and initiatives at the personal level are essential to address the issues of WLB. © The Author(s) 2021.","faculty; gender; Higher Education Institutions (HEI); Karnataka; work-life balance",,,,,,"02/04/2015-16/ICSSR/RPR; Indian Council of Social Science Research, ICSSR","The author(s) disclosed receipt of the following financial support for the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article: Author has received research grants from Indian Council of Social Science Research, Government of India (Grant No. F.

This article reports on the Australian findings from a large-scale survey of academic staff and their experiences and predictions of the impact of the pandemic on their wellbeing. We report the perceptions of n = 370 Australian academics and accounts of their institutions’ responses to COVID-19, analysed using self-determination theory. Respondents report work-related stress, digital fatigue, and a negative impact on work-life balance; as well as significant concerns over potential longer-term changes to academia as a result of the pandemic. Respondents also articulate their frustration with Australia’s neoliberal policy architecture and the myopia of quasi-market reform, which has spawned an excessive reliance on international students as a pillar of income generation and therefore jeopardised institutional solvency–particularly during the pandemic. Conversely, respondents identify a number of ‘silver linings’ which speak to the resilience of academics. © 2021 HERDSA.","academics; Australia; COVID-19; self-determination theory; wellbeing",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Abery, E., Shipman Gunson, J., The cycle of student and staff wellbeing: Emotional labour and extension requests in higher education.

There is a greater accent on Virtual communication. This paper aims to establish a relationship between Emotional intelligence and the effectiveness of Virtual communication on Decision making. This empirical study is based on a sample drawn from 296 working professionals at five different levels of organizational hierarchy. A standardized questionnaire (ɑ = 0.824) was used to collect the responses of Emotional intelligence, Virtual communication, and Decision-making effectiveness. Hierarchical regression using PROCESS Macro model 1 was used to identify the moderating effect of Emotional intelligence on Virtual communication and Decision making effectiveness. Since the p-value (p ≤.007) is found significant, Emotional intelligence acts as a moderator that affects the strength of the relationship between Virtual communication effectiveness and Decision making. Validation of Task Technology fit theory is the theoretical implication of the study. Manipulation of individual dimensions in the model can reduce the dependence on technology for task completion with enhanced performance effectiveness. The findings are relevant to educators, consultants, and any professional who need to adapt Virtual communication platforms on an ongoing basis. Since work-life balance is projected as a constraint in this study, policymakers can consider policy amendments to reduce the stress caused due to Virtual communication which intrudes into their personal space. This empirical study is the first of its kind to benchmark the organizational practice of Emotional intelligence training to enhance Virtual communication and Decision making effectiveness during unprecedented times of pandemic. © 2021, The Author(s).","COVID-19; Disaster; Emotional intelligence; Hierarchical regression; Pandemic; Task technology fit theory; Virtual communication",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Acai, A., Sonnadara, R.R., O’Neill, T.A., Getting with the times: A narrative review of the literature on group decision making in virtual environments and implications for promotions committees (2018) Perspectives on Medical Education, 7 (3), pp. 147-155; (2020) More big employers are talking about permanent work-from-home positions.

Design/methodology/approach: Data were collected from 180 working professionals in North India who were working from home during the lockdown. PROCESS macro developed for SPSS was used to test the hypotheses. Findings: Findings depicted that in comparison to men, women felt more emotional exhaustion due to personal life interference in work during work from home period. Surprisingly, the relationship between work interference with personal life, and emotional exhaustion did not differ by gender. It was found that the participative leadership could contribute to reduction of work interference with personal life, and through such an influence, emotional exhaustion experienced by an employee could be reduced to some extent. Originality/value: Many previous studies have explored the nature of the relationship between work–life balance and emotional exhaustion, but rarely any study could cover any Pandemic affected working scenario. This study attempted to investigate such a relationship when employees were obligated to mandatorily work from home during the countrywide lockdown. © 2020, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Emotional exhaustion; Gender; Participative leadership; Work–life balance",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Allen, T.D., Cho, E., Meier, L.L., Work–family boundary dynamics (2014) Annual Review of Organizational Psychology and Organizational Behavior, 1 (1), pp. 99-121; Ashforth, B.E., Kreiner, G.E., Fugate, M., All in a day's work: boundaries and micro role transitions (2000) Academy of Management Review, 25 (3), pp. 472-491; Bacharach, S.B., Bamberger, P., Conely, S., Work-home conflict among nurses and engineers: mediating the impact of stress on burnout and satisfaction at work (1991) Journal of Organizational Behavior, 12 (1), pp. 39-53; Bagozzi, R.P., Yi, Y., On the evaluation of structural equation models (1988) Journal of the Academy of Marketing Science, 16 (1), pp. 74-94; Blanch, A., Aluja, A., Social support (family and supervisor), work–family conflict, and burnout: sex differences (2012) Human Relations, 65 (7), pp. 811-833; Bloom, N., Liang, J., Roberts, J., Ying, Z.J., Does working from home work?

However, there is lack of substantial information on career progression of pharmaceutical physicians in India. Materials and Methods: This cross-sectional survey involved distribution of a questionnaire via internet, to be self-administered and returned electronically from March 1, 2018, to May 31, 2018 (3 months). Respondents were pharmaceutical physicians from India. Results: Of the 410 surveyed across 32 specialties, 197 completed responses (48%) were analyzed. Top physician specialty noted was Pharmacology. Medical Advisors constituted bulk responders. Oncology and Medical Affairs were the preferred therapeutic segment and portfolio, respectively. Medical affairs also recorded the highest physician recruitment and retention figures. Majority cited a need for Pharmaceutical Medicine as a specialty curriculum in India. 'MBA' was perceived to be nonenabling for entry-level hires; sensitization through 'industry apprenticeship' was highly recommended in this regard. Better work-life balance and aversion to clinical work were top reasons for physician influx in the industry. Important challenges at workplace included diversified work and difficult colleagues. Work-related issues were a common basis for most job attritions. Annual compensation figures ranged from INR 10-20 Lakhs (at entry-level) to INR 30-40 Lakhs (at senior-manager level); however, salary dissatisfaction was prevalent (58%). Lack of information and aversion to corporate work culture were top reasons for physician hesitancy when considering career options in the pharmaceutical industry. Conclusion: A career in pharmaceutical medicine has tremendous scope for young medical graduates. One should thoroughly explore such career option and inculcate a learner-centric approach. © 2020 Wolters Kluwer Medknow Publications.

The aim of this cross-sectional study was to analyse health-related quality of life (HRQOL) in morbidly obese women attending a bariatric clinic in India, and assess potential obesity indicators that can be utilised in under-resourced settings, to better understand HRQOL of individual patients. Methods: Anthropometric measurements were collected, including waist circumference, hip circumference, waist-hip ratio, waist-height ratio and body mass index (BMI). HRQOL was assessed using an obesity-related quality-of-life questionnaire focused on the impact of obesity on physical distress, self-esteem, sexual life and work life. Results: The average BMI of study participants was 39.6 kg/m2, with an average HRQOL of 40.2%. The strongest correlation was noted between BMI and HRQOL (R2=0.16). Exploratory analyses demonstrated that patients with higher BMI quartiles had lower scores for physical impact and psychosocial impact, and higher scores for sexual health, comfort with food, and experience with dieting compared to patients in lower quartiles. Conclusion: In South Indian, middle-aged, morbidly obese women, HRQOL is lower than average and is highly correlated with BMI, with different BMI levels having higher impacts in different subcategories, supporting the need for an individualised therapeutic focus for each patient. © 2020 Touch Briefings.

In the literature, few recently published studies exist that document the challenges faced by female scientists in their workplaces. The purpose of this study was to understand the challenges and coping strategies faced by female scientists around the world today, in order to contribute to their improved performance. A multi-centre electronic cross-sectional survey across 55 countries was conducted to profile female scientists and to identify the challenges that they experience throughout their career as well as the coping mechanisms that they use to overcome the barriers. A total of 263 female scientists from different countries across the world participated in our study and most participants were from the South East Asian Region. Most female scientists in our study belong to the middle and junior level career category and earning around 1250 USD per month. Most of the scientists reported availability of maternity leave at their workplace but less than a third reported presence of a creche at work. Workplace sexual harassment was reported by 24% of the study population. Work related stress (71.5%) and work life imbalance (46%) are also major challenges faced by female scientists. Self-confidence, dedication and hard work are the most commonly adopted coping strategy. Flexible work timings, woman-friendly management policies, fair appraisal and mentorship appear to reduce the work-related stress and improve work-life balance among female scientists. In conclusion, female scientists face numerous challenges, which can greatly affect both their individual and career growth.

Particularly, empowering empower women in rural areas is both challenging and essential. Women entrepreneur faces many barriers to success such as a lack of financial independence and education, family, work-life balance, male-dominated society, and social-culture barrier. The Women Technology Park (WTP) is an initiative that leverages the use of appropriate technology to catalyze economic growth and development of rural women by raising their productivity, generating sustainable income, and improving their livelihoods. This paper uses a WTP model to illustrate the process of developing, training and enabling of rural technologies related to metal art, banana fiber extraction, weaving, construction and habitat services, and food processing technologies. It presents how a WTP acts as a resource center and a catalyst to translate opportunities into reality to empower rural women. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.",,,,,,,"Department of Science and Technology, Government of Kerala: SEED/WTP/131/2014","The authors would like to acknowledge the support of the Department of Science and Technology, New Delhi under Grant No: SEED/WTP/131/2014 to carry out the present work.",,,,,,,,,,"Nehru, J., Bhardwaj, S., Women entrepreneurship in India: Issues & Problems - You can tell the condition of a nation by looking at the status of its women (2013) Spectrum: A J. of Multidisci.

Reliance Foundation Hospital, Mumbai, India","Background: In the fight against COVID 19, the government of India announced a 3 weeks lockdown of the entire country of 1.3 billion people on 24th March 2020. Methods: One week after the lockdown was announced, we conducted an anonymous online survey of the orthopaedic surgeons in India through social media platforms to assess the impact of the lockdown during COVID 19. The survey had a total of 13 questions with (3–5) options and was designed with an aim to understand the perception and the state of mind of the Orthopaedic surgeons in the lockdown situation. Results: The survey was completed by 611 orthopaedic surgeons from 140 cities in India. There were 22.5% orthopaedic surgeons who said that they were definitely stressed out, and 40.5% who said they were mildly stressed out. As the age decreased, the percentage of orthopaedic surgeons feeling “definitely stressed out” increased. Disruption of life-work balance and uncertainties regarding return to work were other strongly associated factors with the “definitely stressed out” group. Conclusion: The psychological impact of the lockdown during COVID 19 on orthopaedic surgeons may become a potential concern that will require addressal through open discussion.

However, there is little knowledge about their perceptions of professional environment, unique challenges and opportunities compared with male counterparts. The problem is more prominent in lower-income and middle-income countries like India and merits exploration. Materials and methods A survey, â € Exploratory Study on the Challenges of Female Oncologists in India', was conducted among oncology professionals. We included questions on demography, working team details, role at work, perceived challenges for advancement of career, gender-related values brought into the team and the measures for improvement of gender disparity. Lead authorship data were collected from two Indian oncology journals. Results Of the 324 respondents, 198 (61.1%) were women. Majority of the respondents were medical oncologists (46.3%), ≤45 years old (69.4%) and working in universities and corporate hospitals (71.6%). One hundred eighty-nine (58.3%) respondents worked in teams with male majority, 50 (15.4%) in women-majority teams, while 85 (26.2%) worked in teams with gender equality. Of the 324 respondents, 218 (67.3%) had men managers, while 106 (32.7%) had women managers. Men led 160 (84.7%) male-majority teams; 45 (52.9%) gender-equal teams; and 13 (26%) female-majority teams (p<0.00001). Age >45 years was found to be associated with a leadership role (43% vs 25%, p=0.0012). The most significant barrier perceived for advancement of career for women was finding a work-life balance. Most respondents suggested provision of flexible training programmes to improve the disparity. Of the 558 journal publications inspected, 145 (26%) articles had a female first or corresponding author. Conclusions The study brought out the current figures regarding gender climate in oncology practice and academia across India. We identified lead thrust areas and schemes to improve the gender bias. There needs to be action at international, national and personal levels to bring about an efficient gender-neutral workforce. © Author (s) (or their employer(s)) 2020.

Aim and objective: To assess the predictors of psychological well-being in Southern India. Settings and design: A cross-sectional study was conducted among 460 high school teachers from government and private schools in Udupi district. Methods and materials: Ryff’s psychological well-being scale (1989) was used. Statistical analysis used: Predictors were identified using logistic regression and p<0.05 was considered to be statistically significant Results: Autonomy, personal growth, positive relations, purpose in life and self-acceptance emerged as predictors of psychological well-being. Age predicted the subdomain of autonomy; number and age of children predicted environmental mastery; gender, monthly income and travelling time of teachers predicted the subdomain of self-acceptance among teachers. Conclusion: Teachers are an important resource whose psychological well-being has not received the attention it is due. An intervention program designed to fit their felt needs may be a step in the right direction. © 2020, Indian Association of Preventive and Social Medicine.

In view of diverse needs of plateaued employees’ organisations must change the ways in which they get their work done and redefine their social contract that connects them. Increased diversity in the organisation in terms of age, gender, and culture brings in additional challenge for human resource management. It comes under work force diversity intervention. Finally, organisations have increased their focus on wellbeing of their plateaued employees using programs such as stress management counselling, work life balance, health and fitness consciousness. career planning and development interventions helps to recruit and retain skilled and knowledgeable workers. Career is the route map of a person’s life.

OCB refers to the extra role behaviour exhibited by the employees which is not prescribed or it is beyond their contractual tasks. 240 valid responses were obtained from the employees working in an IT company in Bangalore. From the literature review two new categories of OCB were identified as employee sustainability and voice behaviour. Each dimension was studied thoroughly and correlation was done to find out the interrelation between these dimensions of OCB and job contentedness. Linear regression was applied to predict the values of one or more independent variables for the dependant variable. The results of the research indicated there is strong correlation between various categories of OCB and job satisfaction and further OCB and job satisfaction are statistically significant with each other. The results of descriptive analysis reveals “praising other employees work when they are successful” as the most important factor with the highest mean value. Gender and age did not have a positive association with OCB. The findings give an insight into the importance of OCB behaviours at workplace for every organization and implementation of these extra-role behaviours help in improving the work life balance of the employees and enhance in creating a tending environment for learning and growth. © BEIESP.","IT professionals; Job satisfaction; Organization citizenship behaviour",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Azmi, F.T., Desai, K., Jayakrishnan, K., Organizational citizenship behavior (OCB): A comprehensive literature review (2016) Sumedha Journal of Management, 5 (1), p. 102; Biswas, N., Mazumder, Z., Exploring organizational citizenship behavior as an outcome of job satisfaction: A critical review (2017) IUP Journal of Organizational Behavior, 16 (2); Bowling, N.A., Wang, Q., Li, H.Y., The moderating effect of core self‐evaluations on the relationships between job attitudes and organisational citizenship behavior (2012) Applied Psychology, 61 (1), pp. 97-113; Carpitella, B., Make residential construction the industry of choice [Electronic version] (2003) Professional Builder, , Oct 2003; Choudhury, J., Quality Of Work Life, Employee Commitment And Organization Citizenship Behavior (A Study Of IT Professionals In Odisha) (2015) Journal of Commerce and Management Thought, 6 (4), p. 656; Cohrs, J.C., Kämpfe-Hargrave, N., Riemann, R., Individual differences in ideological attitudes and prejudice: Evidence from peer-report data (2012) Journal of Personality and Social Psychology, 103 (2), p. 343; Dekas, K.H., Bauer, T.N., Welle, B., Kurkoski, J., Sullivan, S., Organizational citizenship behavior, version 2.0: A review and qualitative investigation of OCBs for knowledge workers at Google and beyond (2013) Academy of Management Perspectives, 27 (3), pp. 219-237; Lease, S.H., Annual review, 1993–1997: Work attitudes and outcomes (1998) Journal of Vocational Behavior, 53 (2), pp. 154-183; Locke, E.A., The nature and causes of job satisfaction (1976) Handbook of Industrial and Organizational Psychology; Indarti, S., Fernandes, A.A.R., Hakim, W., The effect of OCB in relationship between personality, organizational commitment and job satisfaction on performance (2017) Journal of Management Development, 36 (10), pp. 1283-1293; Munn, N., (1961) Psychology: The Fundamentals of Human Adjustment, , 4th Edition).

The present research attempts to narrow the research gaps by hypothesizing that HR practices (job security, work-life balance and training opportunities) significantly influence employee retention. The research employs a quantitative research approach whereby data were collected from 109 ICT professionals from MSC status companies in Malaysia. For analyzing the hypothesis, the SEM analysis is conducted. The research found that HR practices significantly influence employee retention among ICT professionals in Malaysia. It was also found that LMX mediates the relationship between HR practices and employee retention. Several implications from this research were discussed. In particular, HR managers, corporate leaders as well as government leaders and officials may use the findings of this research to justify the efforts in designing performance improvement interventions so that employee retention will be monitored and further enhanced among ICT professionals in Malaysia. Several other implications were further discussed. © BEIESP.","Human resource practices; Job security; Leader member exchange; Retention; Training opportunities; Worklife balance",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Hiring Demand Improves in Q1 2016 despite Key Concerns., , http://www.jobstreet.com.my/career-resources/hiring-demand-, Retrieved Feb 17, 2016 from; Key Insights to Attract, Reward and Retain Talent in Malaysia: Aon Hewitt’s Views, , http://www.hrinasia.com/recruitment/key-insights-to-attract-reward-and-retain-talent-in-malaysia-aon-hewitts-views/29, Retrieved Dec, 3 2015 from; (2017), https://www.mdec.my/mscapplication/, Retrieved from; Boxall, P., Purcell, P., (2008) Strategy and Human Resource Management, , 2nd ed.,Palgrave Macmillan, Basingstoke; Veth, K.N., Korzilius, H.P., van der Heijden, B.I., Emans, B.J., de Lange, A.H., Which HRM practices enhance employee outcomes at work across the life-span?

The happy working environment plays a fundamental role in the personal and working life of the employees. Also, it is such an environment which helps the organisation to run effectively and efficiently. Most of the organizations who give much importance to the decent work-life of the employees have been successful in the effective running of their business. The present paper is a study aimed at analyzing the factors of the quality of work-life of the bus drivers and conductors of Puducherry Road Transport Corporation and their determining influence on job stress, job commitment, job satisfaction and work-life balance. The primary data were collected by using the questionnaire from the 445 respondents working from the four regions such as Puducherry, Karaikal, Mahe and Yanam at Puducherry Road Transport Corporation. The respondents also vary from the nature of employment viz., permanent, temporary, part-time and daily wages. The researchers employed statistical tools such as Cluster Analysis, Chi-Square analysis and Linear Multiple regression analysis for the study about the intrinsic relationship among the factors of quality of work-life and with other four effects of quality of work-life. The research found that there exists a deep association between quality of work-life of employees in the Puducherry Road Transport Corporation and their job stress, job commitment, job satisfaction and work-life balance. The study concluded that quality of work life is significant to permanent employees,whereas the quality of work-life is insignificant to contract employees. The research work emphasized that the quality of work-life directly depends upon the satisfaction level of the employees. Thus study concluded that the employees’ satisfaction level influences the quality of work life in the organisation. The study will facilitate the top management to consider all the grievances to help them to cop up with needs of employees and improve the Job Commitment, Job Satisfaction and Job Stress in the Transport Sector. © BEIESP.","Human resources; Job satisfaction; Quality of life; Wages; Working conditions",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Almaghrabi, (2007) Systematic and Behavioral Skills for HR Development, , Cairo: The Modern Library for Publication and Distribution; Almalki, M.J., FitzGerald, G., Clark, M., Quality of work-life among primary health care nurses in the Jazan region, Saudi Arabia: A cross-sectional study (2012) Human Resources for Health, 10, p. 30; Almarshad, S.O., A Measurement Scale for Evaluating Quality of Work-life: Conceptualization and Empirical Validation (2015) Trends in Applied Sciences Research, 10, pp. 143-156; Alzalabani, (2012) Employee Voice Mechanisms in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, 22, pp. 145-176; Bagtasos, M.R., Quality of work-life: A review of the literature (2011) DLSU Business& Economics Review, 20, pp. 1-8; Belwal, S., Belwal, R., Work-Life Balance, Family-Friendly Policies and Quality of Work-life Issues: Studying Employers’ Perspectives of Working Women in Oman (2014) Journal of International Women’s Studies, 15, pp. 96-117; George, E., Levenson, A., Finegold, D., Chattopadhyay, P., Extra-role behaviours among temporary workers: How firms create relational wealth in the United States of America (2010) The International Journal of Human Resource Management, 21, pp. 530-550; Deery, S., Iverson, R., Walsh, J., The effect of customer service encounters on job satisfaction and emotional exhaustion (2004) Call Centres and Human Resource Management: A Cross-National Perspective, pp. 201-221. , S.

This holds good for workplace comfort too, as both the genders are equally employed now a days. Especially in a busy sector like banking, where long hours of sitting and compulsion to stay alert, the need for comfort level relatively takes a higher order of importance. This study is attempted to analyse the level of comfort the private bank employees experience at workplace, which ultimately impacts their job satisfaction beyond monetary benefits. The aim of this study is to analyse the relationship of comfort level at workplace towards employee job satisfaction, the factors that impact employee comfort at workplace and to suggest measures to effect a stress-free comfortable workplace for private bank employees. A sample size of 70 has been employed using simple random sampling method and the results thus sought are analysed and interpreted statistically. The results thus derive that there is a significant relationship between gender and job rotation practices; Age and work timing; Age and Promotion practices; Designation and work timing; designation and training and development practices. It is also derived that educational qualification, number of dependents and gender have significant difference with respect to salary; that age, number of dependents and designation have significant difference with respect to Training and development practices in private banking sector. © BEIESP.","Banking industry; Job rotation; Stress; Work life balance; Work pressure; Workplace",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Quick, J.C., Cooper, C.L., (2003) Stress and Strain, p. 75. , 2nd ed.

It is always a great challenge for organizations to retain & motivate a Multi-Generational Workforce to achieve their goals & objectives in a competitive era. The growth and development of an age diversified organization depends upon the performance (PFM) level of personnel working in the organization and their PFM level depends upon both ability & adaptability. As banking sector is automated & every activity is done with the help of computers (IT) it is very tough for banks to deal with multi-generational workforce effectively. The banking sector consists of multi-generational workforce who are different in thought, ideology, attitude & perception & they adapt technology differently. Traditionalist, the silent generation is completely resist to accept technology whereas Baby boomers are little bit sound in technology. Similarly Gen-X is technology friendly & uses technology to make work life balance whereas Gen-Y, the tech savvy generation is completely attached with technology & finally Gen-Z the 5G who is more advanced in technology & cannot walk a single step without the help of IT. In India with the introduction of New Economic Policy (NEP), there was enormous change in banking sector. There was enough scope for private sector banks (LPG, policy) which came to be known as “Tech savvy Banks of New Generation”. The introduction of IT paved new wave of automation in banking sector which enhanced performance & at the same time faced challenges regarding adaptability.

Using the P-E fit perspective, the present study investigated the implications of the perceived fit/ misfit between the expected and the experienced career growth and work-life balance from the technology the IT professionals are working in on their career satisfaction. Based on response surface methodology and polynomial regression analysis of the data collected from 286 IT professionals, the study found that not only the fit, but also the misfit between expected and experienced technology led career growth and work-life balance is important in explaining career satisfaction. Implications of the study for both research and practice were discussed. © 2019 Tomer & Mishra.

They have job obligations on the one hand and family obligations on the other. This generates a confrontation between their commitments to work and to live, which leads to increased stress. Not only does a bad “Work-life balance” affect staff, it also affects employers. Chronic stress level leads to low efficiency. The operating habits have also altered with the development of technology. Employees now use their smartphones, tablets and laptops from a distant place. Although this has significantly contributed to the flexibility of job, the lines of private and work life are blurred. In India, the IT & ITES sector has long been liberated from labor regulations to accelerate its rapid development and worldwide market capability. Although this is a thorough argument for sustaining and expanding economic growth in the aftermath of our developing economy, it still requires to be checked if the pressure is not carried by the workforce of the industry. Keeping in view of the challenges faced by the employees of in IT & ITES industry the researcher has taken Visakhapatnam district of Andhra Pradesh as a sample to study the work life balance, where more than 10,000 employees are working. © AesthetixMS 2019.","IT & ITES industry; Work culture; Work life balance; Work-family balance",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Kodz, J., Harper, H., Dench, S., Work-life balance (2002) Beyond the Rhetoric, , Report 384, Institute of Employment Studies, Brighton; Umer, M., Naseem, M.A., Employees retention (human capital) in business process outsourcing (BPO) industry in Pakistan (2011) Global Journal of Management and Business Research, 11 (3), pp. 90-98. , http://www.offshoringtimes.com/BPO_news1378.html, Version 1.0, Pg; Subbarao, S., Employee perception on social security measures in jute industry in post liberalization (2012) ITIHAS –The Journal of Indian Management, 2 (4), pp. 9-18. , April-June 2012; (2019) Coping with BPO Related Stress, , http://www.chrmglobal.com/Articles/267/1/Coping-with-BPO-Related-Stress.html, Think HR think CHRM Accessed on 10-Jul-2019; (2008) Don'T Just Blame Odd Hours for BPO Attrition, , https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/tech/ites/dont-just-blame-odd-hours-for-bpoattrition/articleshow/3116730.cms?from=mdr, ET Bureau, Jun 10, 2008, 02.07 PM IST, Accessed on 20-jun-2019; (2003) Work-Life Balance, , Work Foundation Work Foundation, London","Pasumarti, S.S.; Faculty of Commerce and Management Studies, India",,,"Aesthetics Media Services",,,,,09752935,,,,"English","Rupkatha J.

Looking at it from a demographic level, there are only a few states which have a women workforce larger than the men workforce. The low percentage of working women is both a social and economic loss. According to a survey, it was seen that working women form an integral part of the junior management level comprising 16%, while women comprise only 4% each at the middle and senior levels and as far as organizational leadership positions (CEOs) are concerned they represent only 1%. This suggests that that women’s entry is proportionately large but their progression is very slow (Center for Social Research, 2009). Interestingly, there has been little research done in India around the impact of the challenges that women employees in the managerial cadre face which subsequently has a negative influence on their productivity and efficiency. During the course of this research, external factors such as the glass ceiling, discrimination at the work place, unfriendly organizational policies or internal factors like work-life balance, personal capability and perception and family and also societal factors were identified which present a challenge for women employees. The study aims to investigate the impact of these factors on women employees in terms of their efficiency and productivity (Jamali D., 2006). The research would be conducted for women employees in the managerial cadre in the IT, Civil and Electronics sectors across the country. © 2019 Australasian Accounting Business and Finance Journal and Authors.","Discrimination; Family and societal factors; Glass ceiling; India; Personal capability and perception; Productivity and efficiency; Unfriendly policies; Women employees; Work-life balance",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Andersen, J.A., Hansoon, P.H., At the end of the road?

The current study analyzed the relationship of various facets (Deception, Defensive, Exemplification, Ingratiation, Model behavior, and Self-promotion) of impression management and its effect on global assignment, work-life balance, and career growth. Furthermore, the current study also analyzed the impact of IM on the psychological behavior of IT employees and conceptualized a model using SmartPLS (Partial Least Squares) approach. Questionnaires were distributed to 225 employees (36% female) in a Private Software Company in Chennai, India. Results indicate that the IM facets contribute 51.2% in predicting the individual psychological factor composed of global assignment, work-life balance, and career growth. © 2019 Pontificia Universidad Catolica del Peru.

It is hypothesized that big five personality traits are positively related to different components of WLB and further components of WLB are positively related to different components of EWB. Data were collected from 504 business school teachers through a structured questionnaire from national capital region (NCR) of India. Analysis is done using structural equation modeling. The result indicate that big five personality traits influence all the dimensions of WLB and, hence, are important predictor variables. Finding also suggests that work interference with personal life and health dimensions of WLB significantly impacts EWB. Whereas personal life interference with work and work personal life enhancement dimension of WLB were found to have significant impact on some dimensions of EWB, the outcomes have practical implication in dispositional job design, developing supportive policies, work-life culture and eudaimonia oriented interface for maximizing individual and organizational outcomes. The study reflects towards work-life balance in a novel socio-cultural context and promotes possibility of the mediating role of WLB to the relationships between personality traits and EWB. © 2019 The author(s).

Methods: The current study used quantitative semi-structured interviews and qualitative in-depth interviews to explore emotional exhaustion and burnout in doctors in a tertiary care cancer center. Sociodemographic details, Maslach Burnout Inventory, and Patient Health Questionnaire were used for the quantitative analysis. Results: Increased work pressure (adjusted odds ratio [AOR]: 5.39, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 2.01-14.47, P < 0.01), reduced job-related satisfaction (AOR: 3.56, 95% CI: 1.37-9.25, P < 0.01), being a woman (AOR: 3.4, 95% CI: 1.2-9.5, P < 0.01), and having higher anxiety and depression scores (AOR: 2.89, 95% CI: 1.11-7.46, P = 0.03) were independently associated with higher levels of emotional exhaustion. In the qualitative interviews, many doctors felt working in oncology a satisfying as well as stressful experience. Dealing with palliative and end-of-life situations and counseling patients and their family members about various treatment options contributed to the stress. Male and female clinicians viewed work-life balance differently. Female doctors charted a larger area of influence for which they felt responsible in work and life. Conclusion: Increased work pressure, reduced job satisfaction, and increased affective symptoms contribute to emotional exhaustion in oncology clinicians, and the risk increases especially in female doctors. Having gender-sensitive and employee-friendly policies will likely help in having a nurturing work environment.. © 2019 Indian Journal of Medical and Paediatric Oncology.","Burnout; cancer; depression; emotional exhaustion; oncology; work-life balance","adult; anxiety; Article; depression; developing country; emotional stress; experience; family; female; female physician; human; job satisfaction; male; Maslach Burnout Inventory; medical oncologist; mood disorder; palliative therapy; patient counseling; patient health questionnaire; priority journal; professional burnout; qualitative analysis; quantitative analysis; scoring system; semi structured interview; terminal care; work environment; work-life balance",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Ramirez, A.J., Graham, J., Richards, M.A., Cull, A., Gregory, W.M., Mental health of hospital consultants: The effects of stress and satisfaction at work (1996) Lancet, 347, pp. 724-728; Shanafelt, T., Dyrbye, L., Oncologist burnout: Causes, consequences, and responses (2012) J Clin Oncol, 30, pp. 1235-1241; Leung, J., Rioseco, P., Munro, P., Stress, satisfaction and burnout amongst Australian and New Zealand radiation oncologists (2015) J Med Imaging Radiat Oncol, 59, pp. 115-124; Koh, M.Y., Chong, P.H., Neo, P.S., Ong, Y.J., Yong, W.C., Ong, W.Y., Burnout, psychological morbidity and use of coping mechanisms among palliative care practitioners: A multi-centre cross-sectional study (2015) Palliat Med, 29, pp. 633-642; Taylor, C., Graham, J., Potts, H.W., Richards, M.A., Ramirez, A.J., Changes in mental health of UK hospital consultants since the mid-1990s (2005) Lancet, 366, pp. 742-744; Buckman, R., The invisible effects of therapeutic failure (2010) Oncologist, 15, pp. 1370-1372; Lyckholm, L., Dealing with stress, burnout, and grief in the practice of oncology (2001) Lancet Oncol, 2, pp. 750-755; Chatani, Y., Nomura, K., Ishiguro, A., Jagsi, R., Factors associated with attainment of specialty board qualifications and doctor of medical science degrees among Japanese female doctors (2016) Acad Med, 91, pp. 1173-1180; Hawton, K., Clements, A., Sakarovitch, C., Simkin, S., Deeks, J.J., Suicide in doctors: A study of risk according to gender, seniority and specialty in medical practitioners in England and Wales 1979-1995 (2001) J Epidemiol Community Health, 55, pp. 296-300; Mallath, M.K., Taylor, D.G., Badwe, R.A., Rath, G.K., Shanta, V., Pramesh, C.S., The growing burden of cancer in India: Epidemiology and social context (2014) Lancet Oncol, 15, pp. e205-e212; Jugale, P.V., Mallaiah, P., Krishnamurthy, A., Sangha, R., Burnout and work engagement among dental practitioners in Bangalore city: A cross-sectional study (2016) J Clin Diagn Res, 10, pp. ZC63-ZC67; Pandey, J., Singh, M., Donning the mask: Effects of emotional labour strategies on burnout and job satisfaction in community healthcare (2016) Health Policy Plan, 31, pp. 551-562; Ratnakaran, B., Prabhakaran, A., Karunakaran, V., Prevalence of burnout and its correlates among residents in a tertiary medical center in Kerala, India: A cross-sectional study (2016) J Postgrad Med, 62, pp. 157-161; Tong, A., Sainsbury, P., Craig, J., Consolidated criteria for reporting qualitative research (COREQ): A 32-item checklist for interviews and focus groups (2007) Int J Qual Health Care, 19, pp. 349-357; Maslach, C., Jackson, S.E., (1986) Maslach Burnout Inventory, , Palo Alto California: Consulting Psychologists Press; Kroenke, K., Spitzer, R.L., Williams, J.B., Löwe, B., An ultra-brief screening scale for anxiety and depression: The PHQ-4 (2009) Psychosomatics, 50, pp. 613-621; Braun, V., Clarke, V., Using thematic analysis in psychology (2006) Qual Res Psychol, 3, pp. 77-101; Cubero, D.I., Fumis, R.R., De Sá, T.H., Dettino, A., Costa, F.O., Van Eyll, B.M., Burnout in medical oncology fellows: A prospective multicenter cohort study in Brazilian institutions (2016) J Cancer Educ, 31, pp. 582-587; Gyorffy, Z., Dweik, D., Girasek, E., Reproductive health and burn-out among female physicians: Nationwide, representative study from Hungary (2014) BMC Womens Health, 14, p. 121; Downs, J.A., Reif, L.K., Hokororo, A., Fitzgerald, D.W., Increasing women in leadership in global health (2014) Acad Med, 89, pp. 1103-1107","Datta, S.S.; Department of Palliative Care and Psycho-oncology, Major Arterial Road, India; email: ssdatta2000@yahoo.com",,,"Wolters Kluwer Medknow Publications",,,,,09715851,,,,"English","Indian J.

Cross-Cultural Collaboration on Contemporary Careers (5C) research collaborative","Although career proactivity has positive consequences for an individual's career success, studies mostly examine objective measures of success within single countries. This raises important questions about whether proactivity is equally beneficial for different aspects of subjective career success, and the extent to which these benefits extend across cultures. Drawing on Social Information Processing theory, we examined the relationship between proactive career behaviors and two aspects of subjective career success—financial success and work-life balance—and the moderating role of national culture. We tested our hypotheses using multilevel analyses on a large-scale sample of 11,892 employees from 22 countries covering nine of GLOBE's 10 cultural clusters. Although we found that proactive career behaviors were positively related to subjective financial success, this relationship was not significant for work-life balance. Furthermore, career proactivity was relatively more important for subjective financial success in cultures with high in-group collectivism, high power distance, and low uncertainty avoidance. For work-life balance, career proactivity was relatively more important in cultures characterized by high in-group collectivism and humane orientation. Our findings underline the need to treat subjective career success as a multidimensional construct and highlight the complex role of national culture in shaping the outcomes of career proactivity. © 2018 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.","career self-management; career success; national culture; proactive career behaviors",,,,,,"Japan Society for the Promotion of Science, JSPS: 18K01857",,,,,,,,,,,"Abele, A.E., Wiese, B.S., The nomological network of self-management strategies and career success (2008) Journal of Occupational and Organizational Psychology, 81 (4), pp. 733-749. , https://doi.org/10.1348/096317907X256726; Amabile, T., Kramer, S., (2011) The progress principle: Using small wins to ignite joy, engagement, and creativity at work, , Boston, Harvard Business Press; Arthur, M.B., Khapova, S.N., Wilderom, C.P.M., Career success in a boundaryless career world (2005) Journal of Organizational Behavior, 26 (2), pp. 177-202. , https://doi.org/10.1002/job.290; Aryee, S., Luk, V., Leung, A., Lo, S., Role stressors, interrole conflict, and well-being: The moderating influence of spousal support and coping behaviors among employed parents in Hong Kong (1999) Journal of Vocational Behavior, 54 (2), pp. 259-278. , https://doi.org/10.1006/jvbe.1998.1667; Ashforth, B.E., Kreiner, G.E., Fugate, M., All in a day's work.

Its foundation was laid back in 1991 when our economy was liberalized, giving the organizations required autonomy to work and advance. The increase in the earnings also brought the challenges associated with tremendous growth: competition, reducing margins, technological investments, etc. These challenges brought tremendous pressure on the most important resource of organizations - the human resources. Maintaining work life balance became more and more difficult due to the pressure of meeting deadlines, long working hours, abrupt changes and peer competition. So much so that even surviving in such charged atmosphere became difficult. The present study is an attempt to gauge the effect of emotional intelligence of the middle level managers of Indian service sector on their adversity quotient. © 2018 Author(s).",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Cooper, R.K., Sawaf, A., (1997) Executive EQ: Emotional Intelligence in Leadership and Organizations, , (Grosset/Putnum, New York, NY); Lee, D., (2008) Why You Will Need A Resilient Workforce in Today's Economy, , (HR Times-Winter); Salovey, P., Mayer, J., (1990) Emotional Intelligence, Imagination, Cognition and Personality, 9 (3), pp. 185-211; Mayer, J.D., Salovey, P., Caruso, D.R., (2004) Emotional Intelligence: Theory, Findings, and Implications, Psychological Inquiry, 15, pp. 197-215; Goleman, D., (1995) Emotional Intelligence: Why It Can Matter More Than IQ, , (Bantam Books, New York); Wilding, C., (2007) Emotional Intelligence, , (McGraw-Hill, London); Goleman, D., (1998) Working with Emotional Intelligence, , (Bantam Books, New York); Goleman, D., (1995) Emotional Intelligence: Why It Can Matter More Than IQ, , (Bantam Books, New York); Singh, S., (2004) Development of A Measure of Emotional Intelligence, Psychological Studies, 49, pp. 136-141; Stoltz, P., (1997) Adversity Quotient: Turning Obstacles into Opportunities, pp. 90-98. , John Wiley & Sons Inc; Jebb, Richard, C., (1909) The Rhetoric of Aristotle (Trans.), , (Cambridge University Press); Kumbanaruk, T., Maetheeponkul, T., (2008) Adversity Quotient (AQ), Emotional Quotient (EQ) and Personality of Chinese Businesspeople in Thailand and Chinese Businesspeople in China, 13 (1), pp. 1-18; Maiquez, R., Preolco, A.C., Sausa, L., Talatagod, K., (2015) Predictive Ability of Emotional Intelligence and Adversity Quotient on Academic Performance of USC College Students, , http://peaklearning.com/documents/PEAK_GRI_sauza.pdf; Maureen, M., (2015), The level of Adversity Quotient and Social Skills, Journal of East Asian Studies student leaders Unpublished Undergraduate Thesis, College of Education Arts and Sciences (De la Salle Lipa; Daloos, T., (2015), Emotional intelligence and adversity quotient of selected helping professionals Unpublished Master Thesis Department of Psychology Institute of Arts and Sciences Far Eastern University (Manila); Tripathi, S., (2011) Use of Adversity Quotient in Creating Strong Business Leaders of Tomorrow, , Unpublished doctoral thesis SNDT Women's University (Mumbai); Thi, L., (2007) Adversity Quotient in Predicting Job Performance Viewed Through the Perspective of the Big Five, , Unpublished Masters' Thesis Psykologiske institute University of Oslo; Huijuan, Z., (2009) The Adversity Quotient and Academic Performance among College Students at St. Joseph's College,"" Quezon City, , Unpublished Undergraduate Thesis St. Joseph's College, (Quezon City); Solis, D.B., Lopez, E.R., Stress Level and Adversity Quotient among Single Working Mothers (2015) Asia Pacific Journal of Multidisciplinary Research, 3 (5), pp. 72-79; Cornista, G., Macasaet, C., (2013) Adversity Quotient and Achievement Motivation of Selected Third Year and Fourth Year Psychology Students of de la Salle Lipa, , Unpublished Masters' Thesis, College of Education Arts and Sciences (De La Salle Lipa); Barora, D., (2015) Adversity Quotient and Leadership Skills of School Administrators: Basis for Leadership Enhancement Program, , Unpublished Masters' Thesis Philippine Normal University (Visayas)","Singh, S.; Department of Humanities and Social Sciences, India; email: sandeepsinghchahal07@gmail.com","Nifa F.A.A.Lin C.K.Hussain A.","","American Institute of Physics Inc.","3rd International Conference on Applied Science and Technology, ICAST 2018","10 April 2018 through 12 April 2018",,140017,0094243X,9780735417342,,,"English","AIP Conf.

In organizational perspective, a high standard of work-life balance is essential to continue attracting and retaining its employees; while at the individuals perspective it has a positive impact on attitude, behaviour, and commitment towards both professional and personal life. Work-life balance has become an on-going challenge in contemporary times. Though work-life balance is discussed for various decades and measured with different dimensions, this is high time to measure work-life balance in accordance with present lifestyle. Here comes the role of internet which is twisted with every human being in day to day activities. Internet without social media is unimaginable. Usage of social media results in both productive and unproductive behaviour. Therefore this is a study to measure the usage of social media in personal life and professional life on work-life balance. It is found that social media usage in professional life has more impact on work-life balance which caused due to pre-occupation with social media in workplace. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.",,"Manufacture; Professional aspects; High standards; Human being; Organizational perspectives; Personal lives; Positive impacts; Professional life; Social media; Work-life balance; Social networking (online)",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Singh, S., Measuring Work-life Balance in India (2014) International Journal, 2; Pradhan, R.K., Jena, L.K., Kumari, I.G., Effect of Work-Life Balance on Organizational Citizenship Behaviour: Role of Organizational Commitment (2016) Global Business Review, 17 (3), p. 15S. , 15S-29S; Kietzmann, J.H., Hermkens, K., McCarthy, I.P., Silvestre, B.S., Social media?

This shift in the lives of women indeed gives them more confidence and opportunities to identify their assets, but also brings a challenge as they have to perform equally at home and at work. The attempt of working women to integrate, organize and balance the various problems and activities in their different roles simultaneously puts them under tremendous pressure. Aim: The present study endeavours to gain insight into role conflict and how it influences psychological well-being of school teachers. Materials and Methods: A cross-sectional study was conducted in the government, aided and unaided schools in Udupi, Karnataka. A total of 645 school teachers were interviewed using a self-administered questionnaire. Tools used were Netemeyer scale for role conflict, Brief COPE inventory for coping mechanism and GHQ-12 for assessing psychological well-being. Univariate and multiple logistic regression analyses were carried out to assess the association between role conflict and major variables in the study. Post-hoc test was used to identify the differences in coping among various groups. Results: Religion, age of the children and performing school related work on the weekend were found to be significantly associated with role conflict. Gender was not found to influence role conflict in the present study. No significant association was found between role conflict and psychological well-being. Active coping, religion and use of emotional and instrumental support were the most commonly adopted coping mechanisms. Conclusion: Thus, teachers must be provided a friendly working environment and they must be motivated for their psychological well-being. Stress relieving sessions also would help in balancing the work life. © 2018, Journal of Clinical and Diagnostic Research.

However, the well-being of employees of this mode of transport is paramount in passenger and personal safety. As in any job, the person has to balance work and personal issues. Work-life balance is a concept that supports the effort from an employee in any sector to split their time and energy to balance work and personal lives. Materials and Methods: A cross-sectional study using a structured interview schedule was conducted among 103 Karnataka State Road Transport Corporation (KSRTC) workers in Anekal town, Karnataka, to determine the work-life balance among them. The total score was classified into high, medium, and low work balance categories. The scores for each domain were analyzed separately to derive at the factors which act against work-life balance. Results: Low work-life balance was found in 26 (25.2%) of all subjects. The important factors that affected work-life balance were identified to be shift work, work load, night duties, social functions, and negative attitude of family members. The reasons that motivated them to work were to support family (35%), future security (33%), and to clear personal debts (15.5%). Conclusion: Given the low work-life balance in a quarter of several individuals in this study, there is a need to address this issue to ensure necessary balance and safety and well-being of both road transport employees and passengers. © 2018 Indian Journal of Occupational and Environmental Medicine | Published by Wolters Kluwer - Medknow.","KSRTC workers; personal life; work life; work-life balance","adult; article; cross-sectional study; employee; female; human; Karnataka; male; night; shift work; social status; structured interview; wellbeing; work-life balance; worker; workload",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Bhatnagar, D., Rajadhyaksha, U., Attitudes towards work and family roles and their implications for career growth of women: A report from India (2001) Sex Roles, 7, pp. 549-565; Hughes, J., Bozionelos, N., Work-life balance as source of job dissatisfaction and withdrawal attitudes: An exploratory study on the views of male workers (2007) Pers Rev, 36, pp. 145-154; Clark, S.C., Work/family border theory: A new theory of work/family balance (2000) Hum Relat, 53, p. 747; Parkes, L.P., Langford, P.H., Work-life balance or work-life alignment?

Using data from the India Human Development Survey (2005), we investigate the link between maternal employment and children's arithmetic and reading achievement. We develop a work pattern typology that goes beyond standard measures of employment and captures work intensity and its compatibility with child-rearing in a transitional economy. We find that the relationship between maternal employment and children's outcomes is not unidimensional. For example, children of self-employed mothers are not disadvantaged compared to those with stay-at-home mothers, but maternal employment in salaried jobs or wage work outside the home is negatively associated with cognitive skills in children. However, this negative association is reversed at higher levels of maternal education, suggesting greater access to resources and flexibility associated with better jobs mitigate the negative aspects of maternal employment posed by time constraints. Additionally, maternal employment is associated with maternal involvement in schoolwork and financial investment in academic activities, providing evidence that both time and resources devoted to children's education are significant. © 2018 Elsevier Inc.","Children's cognitive skills; Education; India; Maternal employment","achievement; adult; child; child development; child rearing; cognition; developing country; educational status; employment; female; health care planning; human; India; male; mother; questionnaire; school; work; work-life balance; Achievement; Adult; Child; Child Development; Child Rearing; Cognition; Developing Countries; Educational Status; Employment; Female; Health Resources; Humans; India; Male; Mothers; Schools; Surveys and Questionnaires; Women, Working; Work; Work-Life Balance",,,,,"National Institute of Child Health and Human Development, NICHD; University of Maryland, UMD; Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health and Human Development, NICHD: R01HD041455, R01HD046166, R01HD061048, R24-HD041041; National University of Singapore, NUS","An earlier version of this paper was presented at the 2013 Annual Meeting of the Population Association of America at New Orleans, LA.

However, there are few available studies that discuss the different cultural factors affecting perinatal depression within Asian countries. This study aims to compare the literature regarding related factors relating to perinatal depression in India and Japan, and to synthesize the evidence common to both countries in addition to the country-specific evidence. We conducted a systematic review using several databases (CINAHL, MEDLINE, Pubmed, Ovid, SCOPUS, IndMED, and ICHUSI). Keywords were “antenatal depression” or “postpartum depression”, and “India” or “Japan”. Both Japanese and English language papers were reviewed. The identified evidence was compared between the two countries, as well as with non-Asian countries based on previous reports. In total, 15 articles on India and 35 on Japan were reviewed. Although several factors were shared between the two countries as well as with other non-Asian countries (vulnerable personality, being abused, age, marital conflict, and lower socio-demographic status), some differing factors were identified between India and Japan and non-Asian countries; India: poor socioeconomic status, living only with the husband, pregnancy not welcomed by the husband, a female baby, and poor relationship with in-laws; Japan: infertility treatment, conflict with work–life balance, poor relationships with biological mother or in-laws, and concerns about social relations with the other mother’s friends. To conclude, involving the family and community may be important for implementing both global standardized and culture-specific interventions. In India, treatment involving the in-laws may be effective because large family structure is a significant predictor of perinatal depression. In Japan, a family/community approach involving not only the mother’s family of origin but also the working environment is essential. © 2017 by the authors.

Additional scales were extensively collected from theoretical job stress models and similar questionnaire from different countries. Items were tested in workplace and refined through a pilot survey (n = 400) to examine the reliability and construct validity. Most scales showed acceptable levels of internal consistency, intra-class reliability, and test–retest reliability. Factor analysis and correlation analysis showed that these scales fit the theoretical expectations. These findings provided enough evidences that the new job stress scale is reliable and valid. Although confirmatory analysis should be examined in future studies. The new job stress scale is a useful instrument for organization and academicians to evaluate job stress in modern Indian workplace. © 2016 The Author(s).

It is a healthy blend of both employee's work life and personal life. There are many factors influencing work-life balance of an employee in the organization. The researchers have identified some factors along with demographic variables to study and understand the work life balance. Objectives: The objective is to study the relationship between WLB and study factors. 1. To study the association between demographic variables of respondents and employee work-life balance; to study the variation between the demographic factors and employee work-life balance; to study the effect of individual factors on employee work-life balance; to study the association between employee work-life balance and outcome variable viz., employee satisfaction and retention and to understand the effect of employee work-life balance on employee satisfaction and retention as outcome variable. Method/Analysis: The primary data were collected through the structured questionnaire with the sample size of 120 by adopting simple random sampling and snow-ball method and the statistical tools viz., Chi square test, one-way ANOVA and regression analysis were adopted. The study variables include Demographic variables, Individual variables, and Employee satisfaction and Retention as outcome variables. Findings: The findings show that 49% of respondents were in the age group of 25-35 years. 88% of respondents were male and the rest were female. 78 % of respondents were married. 67% of respondents were in the monthly income group of Rs. 11,000 to Rs. 30,000. 69% of respondents were in the middle level of employment position. The Chi square test concluded that there is an association between employee WLB and demographic factors. The ANOVA test showed that study factors do not vary with the demographic factors.

Further, moderating role of work life balance on psychological well-being and organisational commitment was also explored. Data were collected from 209 teachers working in Special schools and NGOs of Delhi, working for differently-abled children, on the bases of convenient sampling. Statistical techniques like confirmatory factor analyses, structure equation model (SEM) and hierarchical regression were employed to analyze the data. Further, reliability and validity tests were also performed. The study finds that emotional intelligence leads to organisational commitment through the partial mediation of psychological well-being. It is also verified that work-life balance moderates the association between psychological well-being and organisational commitment. This study is limited to non-profit making sector of Delhi region only. This study will be helpful for managers in recognising the increasing importance of emotional intelligence, psychological well being and work-life balance that encourages organisational commitment which further enhances the performance of the organisation and may bring innovativeness in working. © AesthetixMS.","Emotional intelligence; Organisational commitment and work life balance; Psychological well being",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Aghdasi, S., Kiamanesh, A.R., Ebrahim, A.N., Emotional Intelligence and organizational commitment: Testing the mediatory role of occupational stress and job satisfaction (2011) Procedia Social and Behavioural Sciences, 29, pp. 1965-1976; Aghdasi, S., Kiamaneshb, E.A.N., Spector, P., Emotional intelligence and organizational commitment: Testing the mediatory role of occupational stress and job satisfaction (2011) Social and Behavioural Sciences, 29, pp. 1965-1976; Aiken, L.S., West, S.G., (1991) Multiple Regression: Testing and Interpreting Interactions, , Newbury Park: Sage; Allen, N.J., Meyer, J.P., The measurement and antecedents of affective, continuance and normative commitment to the organization (1990) Journal of Occupational Psychology, 63, pp. 1-18; Anderson, J.C., Gerbing, D.W., Structural equation modelling in practice: A review and recommended two-step approach (1988) Psychological Bulletin, 103 (3), pp. 411-423; Arbuckle, J., Wothke, W., (2004) Amos 4 Users Guide, Small Waters Corporation, , Chicago, IL; Arnold, K.A., Turner, N., Barling, J., Kelloway, E.K., Mckee, M.C., Transformational leadership and psychological well-being: The mediating role of meaningful work (2007) Journal of Occupational Health Psychology, 12 (3), pp. 193-203; Baron, R., Parker, J.D.A., (2000) The Handbook of Emotional Intelligence: Theory, Development, Assessment and Application at Home, School, and in the Workplace, , San Francisco: Jossey Bass; Bar-On, R., (2002) EQ-I: Bar-on Emotional Quotient Inventory Technical Manual, , Toronto, Canada: Multi-Health Systems; Baron, R.M., Kenny, D.A., The moderator-mediator variable distinction in social psychological research: Conceptual, strategic and statistical considerations (1986) Journal of Personality and Social Psychology, 51, pp. 1173-1182; Bartram, T., Casimir, G., Djurkovic, N., Leggat, S.G., Stanton, P., Do perceived high performance work systems influence the relationship between emotional labor, burnout and intention to leave?

Surveys predicted that there is a strong growth in ceramic sector. Therefore special attention is given in this paper to analyze the factors influencing employees’ continuation in ceramic manufacturing industries. Work life balance & policies, organization commitment, supervisor support and training & development were the four non-monetary factors considered for analysis. This study explored the facts over employees of ceramic manufacturing industries in India. Statistical tools were utilized to analyze the influence of variables. The analysis revealed that all the four factors were correlated to employee retention. The findings also concluded that work life balance & policies, organization commitment and supervisor support exerted significant influence with employee retention. It is also found that supervisor support exerted more influence that other two factors. Suggestions and limitations of the study were also incorporated. © 2015, Asian Social Science.

Since majority of the IT workforce in India are young it is important to understand whether earlier parameters for work life balance are relevant in the present context. The analysis revealed that the work family conflict has a definitive impact in both men and women in the IT companies. However it was found that women suffer more from work family conflict as they have the dual responsibility though the difference is not significant. To analyze the data collected from the IT employees in India we used linear regression model using Excel and SPSS. The analysis revealed that the gender difference do not impact greatly on the work family conflict. This point out to the fact that we need to rethink on the way we understand the concept of work family conflict among the young IT employees. Contribution to Body of Knowledge: The outcome of this study emphasizes the need for managing work family conflict in the information technology companies. The factors that contribute to work family conflict from gender perspective are clearly brought out methodically.","Conflict; Family demands; Work demands; Work family; Work flexibility; Work life balance",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Ahuja, M.K., Chudoba, K.M., Kacmar, C.J., McKnight, D.H., George, J.F., IT road warriors: Balancing work-family conflict, job autonomy, and work overload to mitigate turnover intentions (2007) MIS Quarterly, 31 (1), pp. 1-17; Allen, N.J., Mayer, J.P., The measurement and antecedents of affective, continuance and normative commitment to the organization (1990) J Occup Psychol, 63 (1), pp. 1-18; Byron, K., A meta-analytic review of work-family conflict and its antecedents (2005) J Vocat Behav, 67 (2), pp. 169-198; Chandra, V., Work-life balance: eastern and western perspectives (2012) Int J Hum Resource Manag, 23 (5), pp. 1040-1056; Clark, S.C., Work/family border theory: A new theory of work/family balance (2000) Hum Relat, 53 (6), pp. 747-770; Clutterbuck, D., (2003) Managing work-life balance: A guide for HR in achieving organisational and individual change, , CIPD Publishing; Demerouti, E., Derks, D., Lieke, L., Bakker, A.B., New Ways of Working: Impact on Working Conditions, Work-Family Balance, and Well-Being (2014) The Impact of ICT on Quality of Working Life, pp. 123-141. , Korunka C, Hoonakker P, editors.

Full development and diffusion of the earlier century innovations has been reflected in mass production techniques, consumption patterns, and the style of functioning of the government. Improved information has enabled the affordability of technology for the common man. Information technology has brought in automated knowledge work tools, advanced robotics, and 3D printing. It has enabled people to work from home thereby ensuring freedom of choice as to where and how they live and work. Various changes including economic ones are pushing organizations to re-evaluate the way they do business and to evolve alternative approaches to work. Flexible work timings and advanced telecommunication that includes conference calling, video conferencing and on line data transfer are some of the 21st C work practices that obviate the need for physical travel and inter alia, counter factors like steep increase in fuel prices. It is also forecast that the Gen Y generation emphasis on work life balance will strategically impact the workplace in the near future. It is also foreseen that increasingly sophisticated Information Technology tools and IT enabled progressive business processes will lead to production processes that are less wasteful, error free in a much higher degree and in turn deliver products that are more sustainable environmentally. On the other hand, on a more ominous note, the shape of the new things has the potential to seriously impact the already fragile demographic equilibrium of the world, if effective countermeasures are not put in place by the business leaders and policy makers. The demographics of the new workforce, the changes in how people will conduct business along with what that ""business"" will look like, and the impact technology will have on both will have a major impact on the role of business, the nature of work, the way work is accomplished and the human resources (HR) organization itself. Culturally diverse work forces also will need to be trained to be sensitive to each other's needs and to work as a team towards fulfilment of organization's goals.","Affordability of technology; Demographic equilibrium; Demographics of the new workforce; Need for training; Technological advances",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Armour, S., Generation Y: They've arrived at work with a new attitude (2005) USA Today, , 6 Nov; Berger, S., How we compete: what companies around the world are doing to make it in today's global economy?

Today's organizations need to be more flexible so that they are equipped to develop their workforce and enjoy their commitment. Therefore, organizations are required to adopt a strategy to improve the employees 'Quality of Work Life' (QWL) to satisfy both the organizational objectives and employee needs. This study reviews the meaning of QWL, analyses constructs of QWL based on models and past research from the perspective of IT Industry in India. The Constructs of QWL discussed are Job satisfaction, Compensation, Human Relation, Working Condition, Grievance, competency development, Stress and well-being. The study concludes that QWL from the perspective of IT Industry employees is challenging both to the individuals and organizations. The implications of this meaning and constructs for future research in QWL from the perspective of IT Industry employees are discussed. © Maxwell Scientific Organization, 2014.","Grievance; Human relation; IT industry; Job satisfaction; Quality of work life; Work-life balance",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Allenspach, H., Flexible Working Hours (1975), p. 64. , International Labour Office, Geneva; Bhatia, S.K., Valecha, G.K., A review of research findings on absenteeism (1981) Indian J.
